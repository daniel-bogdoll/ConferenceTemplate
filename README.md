### Tools
Use [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/de) (does integrate with Overleaf) or [Grammerly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to check your writing style. For LanguageTool, activate the "Acribic Mode"

### Writing Style

A sentence should not be longer than **25 words**.

| Writing Style      | Negative Example | Positive Example | Explanation
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Active Voice      | Oxygen was consumed at a higher rate       | The mouse consumed oxygen at a higher rate       |   Makes the text much easier to comprehend     |
| Oxford Comma      | We monitored temperature, pressure and volume.       | We monitored temperature, pressure, and volume.       | The comma ensures that the last two items are not beeing understood as one       |
| Hyphen      | Please bring the report up-to-date       | Please deliver an up-to-date report       | Use hypens to describe nouns       |
| Verbs instead of abstract nouns | Examination of the metal components was carried out... | We examined the metal components... | Text is easier to read out aloud (max 1 breath per sentence) | Parallel Structures | Our investigation has two goals: 째 to discover root causes of production problems, 째 eliminating uncertainties in design processes | Our investigation has two goals: 째 to discover root causes of production problems, 째 to eliminate uncertainties in design processes | Structured lists


### Tenses

Present Tense: What is known
Past Tense: What you did
Future Tense: What comes after the paper

| Section      | Tense | Notes
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Abstract | Past or Present | Present for general statements and facts
| Introduction      | Present       | Research question: Past, Present or Future       |
| State of the Art      | Past or Present       |        |
| Method      | Past       |        |
| Evaluation      | Past or Present       | Specific results in Past, more general ones in Present       |
| Conclusion      | Present or Future       | Future for Outlook       |
