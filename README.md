# Scientific Writing

This repository contains tips regarding scientific writing and a LaTeX template for conferences. It is synced with an Overleaf project.

## Tools

- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) to write your paper in LaTeX
- [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/de) (does integrate with Overleaf) or [Grammerly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to check your writing style. In LanguageTool, activate  "Acribic Mode"
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) for your literature management. Can be synced with Overleaf.


## Paper Style

"**Get the gestalt right.** I remember being impressed with Fei-Fei (my adviser) once during a reviewing session. I had a stack of 4 papers I had reviewed over the last several hours and she picked them up, **flipped through each one for 10 seconds**, and said one of them was good and the other three bad. Indeed, I was accepting the one and rejecting the other three, but something that took me several hours took her seconds." - [Andrej Karpathy, Head of AI at Tesla](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/)

### Writing Style

A sentence should not be longer than **25 words**.

| Writing Style      | Negative Example | Positive Example | Explanation
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Active Voice      | An error has occurred with your account, but every attempt was made to remedy it.       | We made an error with your account, but we have made every attempt to remedy it.       |   Makes the text much easier to comprehend     |
| Oxford Comma      | We monitored temperature, pressure and volume.       | We monitored temperature, pressure, and volume.       | The comma ensures that the last two items are not beeing understood as one       |
| Hyphen      | Please bring the report up-to-date       | Please deliver an up-to-date report       | Use hyphens to describe nouns       |
| Verbs instead of abstract nouns | Examination of the metal components was carried out... | We examined the metal components... | Text is easier to read out aloud (max 1 breath per sentence) | Parallel Structures | Our investigation has two goals: 째 to discover root causes of production problems, 째 eliminating uncertainties in design processes | Our investigation has two goals: 째 to discover root causes of production problems, 째 to eliminate uncertainties in design processes | Structured lists


### Tenses

- Present Tense: What is known
- Past Tense: What you did
- Future Tense: What comes after the paper

| Section      | Tense | Notes
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Abstract | Past or Present | Present for general statements and facts
| Introduction      | Present       | Research question: Past, Present or Future       |
| State of the Art      | Past or Present       | If something is always true, then it should be written in present tense       |
| Method      | Past       |        |
| Evaluation      | Past or Present       | Specific results in Past, more general ones in Present       |
| Conclusion      | Present or Future       | Future for Outlook       |

## Citations

Citations need to be consistent, a bad example would be to include the release month in some papers but not in others.
