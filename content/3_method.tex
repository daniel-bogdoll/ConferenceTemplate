\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Describe your experimental design with enough detail so that a competent colleague could reproduce your results. Passive voice sometimes functions well in the Methods section.
Elsewhere in a scientific paper, however, it should rarely be chosen. Figures need to be included in JPEG, PNG, or PDF format only.
